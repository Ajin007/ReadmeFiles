# Concept Questions Based on the Topics

## 1. Internal and External Tables in Hive

### Question:
What is the difference between an internal (managed) table and an external table in Hive, and when should each be used?

### Explanation:
- **Internal Tables (Managed Tables)**: Hive manages both the metadata and data. If you drop the table, Hive removes both the metadata and the actual data from HDFS.
  - **Use Case**: Use internal tables when you want Hive to manage both the metadata and the data (for example, when you don't need the data to persist after dropping the table).
  
- **External Tables**: Hive manages only the metadata; the data is stored outside Hive (in HDFS, for example). When you drop an external table, the data remains in HDFS.
  - **Use Case**: Use external tables when you want to keep your data even if the table is dropped (e.g., when data is shared between multiple applications).

### Example:
```sql
-- Internal Table
CREATE TABLE internal_table (id INT, name STRING);
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/data/input_data.txt' INTO TABLE internal_table;

-- External Table
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE external_table (id INT, name STRING)
LOCATION '/user/hive/external_data/';
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/data/input_data.txt' INTO TABLE external_table;
```

## 2. Loading Data from HDFS to Hive

### Question:
Explain how to load data from HDFS into Hive, and mention the difference between `LOAD DATA` and `INSERT INTO`.

### Explanation:
- **`LOAD DATA`**: This command is used to load data from an HDFS path or local file system into a Hive table. It’s typically used for batch loading data into the table.
  - **Use Case**: Use it to load large datasets into Hive from HDFS.
  
- **`INSERT INTO`**: This command is used to insert data into an existing Hive table, often used for inserting query results into a table. It can be used to insert rows into an empty table or append rows to an existing table.
  - **Use Case**: Use it to insert processed or transformed data into the table.

### Example:
```sql
-- Load data into an internal table
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/data/input_data.txt' INTO TABLE internal_table;

-- Insert data into a table
INSERT INTO TABLE external_table SELECT * FROM another_table;
```

## 3. ACID Tables in Hive

### Question:
What are ACID tables in Hive, and how do they support transactions like updates and deletes?

### Explanation:
- **ACID Tables**: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) tables in Hive allow transactional operations such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` on the data. ACID tables ensure that these operations are handled in a way that guarantees data consistency.
  - **Use Case**: When you need to perform insert, update, and delete operations on Hive data, ACID tables provide the functionality and reliability of database transactions.

### Example:
```sql
-- Enabling ACID in Hive
SET hive.support.concurrency = true;
SET hive.enforce.bucketing = true;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;

-- Creating an ACID Table
CREATE TABLE acid_table (id INT, name STRING)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS
STORED AS ORC
TBLPROPERTIES ('transactional'='true');

-- Insert data into the ACID table
INSERT INTO acid_table VALUES (1, 'John');
```

## 4. Describe Formatting Command, Bucketing, Partitioning, High Cardinality, and Low Cardinality

### Question:
How does the `DESCRIBE FORMATTED` command work in Hive, and how does bucketing and partitioning help in data management? Also, explain the concepts of high and low cardinality.

### Explanation:
- **`DESCRIBE FORMATTED`**: This command gives detailed information about a Hive table’s schema, storage format, and properties.
  - **Use Case**: Use it to inspect the structure and properties of a table in Hive.

- **Bucketing**: Bucketing divides data into a fixed number of files (buckets). It’s useful when you want to distribute data evenly.
  - **Use Case**: Bucketing is useful when performing operations like joins on a specific column.

- **Partitioning**: Partitioning divides data into multiple directories based on a column (e.g., `year`, `month`). It’s more efficient for querying large datasets.
  - **Use Case**: Partitioning is ideal for time-series data or any data that can be grouped into discrete partitions.

- **High Cardinality**: High cardinality means a column contains many distinct values (e.g., `user_id`).
  - **Use Case**: High cardinality columns are often used for partitioning or bucketing.

- **Low Cardinality**: Low cardinality means a column contains fewer distinct values (e.g., `gender`).
  - **Use Case**: Low cardinality columns are not ideal for partitioning but may be good for bucketing.

### Example:
```sql
-- Describe table structure
DESCRIBE FORMATTED my_table;

-- Partitioned Table
CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    id INT,
    product STRING,
    amount DOUBLE
)
PARTITIONED BY (year INT, month INT);

-- Bucketed Table
CREATE TABLE bucketed_table (
    id INT,
    name STRING
)
CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 4 BUCKETS;
```

## 5. What is a Mapper and Reducer in MapReduce? What is HDFS? What are Namenode, Secondarynamenode, and YARN?

### Question:
Explain the concepts of Mapper, Reducer, HDFS, Namenode, Secondarynamenode, and YARN.

### Explanation:
- **Mapper**: The mapper processes input data and converts it into key-value pairs.
  - **Use Case**: The mapper’s job is to process data in parallel for distributed computing.
  
- **Reducer**: The reducer aggregates the output from mappers to generate a final result.
  - **Use Case**: The reducer takes the intermediate output from the mappers and consolidates it into a final output.

- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**: HDFS is the file storage system for Hadoop, designed to store large datasets across multiple machines.
  - **Use Case**: Use HDFS for storing data that is too large to fit on a single machine.

- **Namenode**: The Namenode is the master node that manages the HDFS namespace and metadata (e.g., directory structure and file locations).
  - **Use Case**: It is the central authority for managing the HDFS filesystem.

- **Secondarynamenode**: The Secondarynamenode periodically merges the edits log into the fsimage, but it is not a backup of the Namenode. It helps in optimizing the Namenode's memory usage.
  - **Use Case**: It helps to prevent Namenode from running out of memory by periodically checkpointing the namespace.

- **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)**: YARN is the resource management layer of Hadoop. It manages resources and schedules tasks across the Hadoop cluster.
  - **Use Case**: YARN is used to allocate resources to applications and manage job execution.

### Example:
```bash
# Running a MapReduce Job
hadoop jar my_mapreduce_job.jar input_dir output_dir

# HDFS Commands
hdfs dfs -put /local/file.txt /user/hive/warehouse/input_data.txt
hdfs dfs -ls /user/hive/warehouse
```

## 6. Simple CRUD Queries in Hive

### Question:
Provide simple CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in Hive using a sample table.

### Explanation:
CRUD operations are fundamental to managing data in a Hive table.

- **Create**: Create a table in Hive.
- **Read**: Select data from the table.
- **Update**: Update existing records in the table.
- **Delete**: Delete records from the table.

### Example:
```sql
-- Create Table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name STRING,
    emp_salary DOUBLE
);

-- Insert Data
INSERT INTO TABLE employees VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);

-- Select Data (Read)
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Update Data
UPDATE employees SET emp_salary = 55000 WHERE emp_id = 1;

-- Delete Data
DELETE FROM employees WHERE emp_id = 1;
```

**Real-Time Example**:
- **Create**: When adding a new employee record.
- **Read**: When querying the salary of employees.
- **Update**: When an employee's salary is updated.
- **Delete**: When an employee leaves the company and their record needs to be removed.

# Hive Query Execution Engines: MR, Tez, and Spark

Hive supports multiple query execution engines, each with its own advantages and trade-offs.
