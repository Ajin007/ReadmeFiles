# Important points to remember:

1. why defer is used in the script tag ?
  Scripts using defer run only after the entire HTML is parsed, preventing errors when trying to manipulate elements that haven’t loaded yet.
2. when to use the defer?
   When your script manipulates DOM elements (e.g., adding event listeners, modifying content).
When you want faster page rendering by avoiding script-blocking.
When loading external scripts that don’t need to run immediately.
3. How the ARIA works ?
