# C# vs Java: A Comprehensive Comparison

## 1. Basic Syntax
### C#
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
    }
}
```

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

## 2. Data Types
### Common Data Types
- int
- float
- double
- char
- boolean

### C#
- `var` for implicit typing (from C# 3.0)
```csharp
var number = 10; // Implicitly typed
```

### Java
- `var` in Java is available from Java 10 onwards
```java
var number = 10; // Implicitly typed
```

## 3. Object-Oriented Concepts

### C#
- C# uses the `namespace` keyword to organize code.
- C# properties are used in place of getters/setters.

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

### Java
- Java uses `package` for code organization.
- Explicit getter/setter methods for accessing private fields.
```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
}
```

## 4. Constructors and Inheritance
### C#
- C# supports constructors and uses `: base()` to call a parent constructor.

```csharp
class Student : Person
{
    public int RollNo { get; set; }
    public Student(string name, int age, int rollNo) : base(name, age) {
        RollNo = rollNo;
    }
}
```

### Java
- Java uses `super()` to call the parent constructor.

```java
class Student extends Person {
    private int rollNo;

    public Student(String name, int age, int rollNo) {
        super(name, age);
        this.rollNo = rollNo;
    }
}
```

## 5. Interfaces

### C#
- Interfaces can contain properties, methods, and events.
```csharp
interface IShape {
    void Draw();
}
```

### Java
- Interfaces can only contain method signatures.
```java
interface IShape {
    void draw();
}
```

## 6. Memory Management

### C#
- Uses garbage collection, but also provides `IDisposable` and the `using` keyword for resource management.

```csharp
using (var stream = new FileStream("file.txt", FileMode.Open))
{
    // File handling code
}
```

### Java
- Relies on garbage collection. Resources are handled through `try-with-resources`.

```java
try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file.txt")) {
    // File handling code
}
```

## 7. Exception Handling

### C# and Java
Both use `try-catch-finally` for handling exceptions.

```csharp
try {
    // Code that may throw exception
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // Handle exception
} finally {
    // Always executes
}
```

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw exception
} catch (Exception ex) {
    // Handle exception
} finally {
    // Always executes
}
```

## 8. Delegates and Events (C# Specific)

### C#
- Delegates are used to pass methods as arguments and to create events.

```csharp
delegate void Notify();
event Notify OnNotify;
```

### Java
- Java uses functional interfaces but lacks direct equivalents to C# events and delegates.

## 9. Asynchronous Programming

### C#
- Uses `async` and `await` for asynchronous operations.
```csharp
public async Task<int> GetDataAsync() {
    return await Task.Run(() => 42);
}
```

### Java
- Java uses `CompletableFuture` for handling async operations.
```java
CompletableFuture<Integer> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42);
```

## 10. LINQ (C# Specific)

### C#
- LINQ allows querying collections in a declarative manner.

```csharp
var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0).ToList();
```

### Java
- Java lacks a direct equivalent of LINQ, but `Streams` API provides similar functionality.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
List<Integer> evenNumbers = numbers.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## 11. Multithreading

### C#
- C# uses `Thread` and `Task` classes for multithreading.
```csharp
Task.Run(() => {
    // Async task code
});
```

### Java
- Java uses `Thread` and `ExecutorService` for multithreading.
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(() -> {
    // Task code
});
```

## 12. Advanced Topics

### C#
- **Reflection**: C# has extensive reflection capabilities for inspecting metadata and working with types at runtime.
```csharp
Type type = typeof(Person);
Console.WriteLine(type.Name);
```

- **Nullable Types**: C# supports nullable value types with `?`.
```csharp
int? number = null;
```

### Java
- **Reflection**: Java has reflection, but its usage is more cumbersome compared to C#.
```java
Class<?> clazz = Person.class;
System.out.println(clazz.getName());
```

- **Null Handling**: Java does not have built-in support for nullable types.

## 13. Key Differences

### C# vs Java Key Features:
- **C#** has better support for Windows-based applications and integration with .NET ecosystem.
- **Java** is platform-independent and runs on JVM, making it more versatile for cross-platform development.

### C# vs Java Memory Management:
- C# has more tools for resource management, such as `IDisposable` and `using` keyword.
- Java uses automatic garbage collection but lacks direct control over unmanaged resources.

### C# vs Java Syntax:
- **C#** is more flexible with properties, events, and delegates compared to Java's more traditional OOP approach.
- **Java** has more verbose syntax for working with getter/setter methods.

## 14. Conclusion
Both C# and Java are powerful languages that share many similarities but have different ecosystems. C# is often used in Windows-based development and .NET applications, while Java excels in cross-platform applications, particularly on Android and large-scale enterprise solutions.

For someone with a Java background, transitioning to C# will feel intuitive because both languages share similar paradigms and structures.
