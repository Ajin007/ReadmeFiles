# Java, Collections, Spring Boot, and Angular Questions

## Java

1. **Question:** What is the difference between `==` and `.equals()` in Java?
   - **Answer:** `==` checks for reference equality (whether two references point to the same object in memory), while `.equals()` checks for content equality (whether two objects have the same state).

2. **Question:** Explain the concept of method overloading in Java with an example.
   - **Answer:** Method overloading allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but different parameters. Example:
     ```java
     public void add(int a, int b) { ... }
     public void add(double a, double b) { ... }
     ```

3. **Question:** What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in Java?
   - **Answer:** `ArrayList` is backed by an array and allows fast access but slower insertions/removals. `LinkedList` is backed by a doubly linked list and is efficient in insertions and deletions but slower in accessing elements.

4. **Question:** How does the `HashMap` work in Java? Explain its internal working.
   - **Answer:** `HashMap` uses a hash table for storing key-value pairs. It calculates the hashcode of the key, maps it to an index in an array, and stores the value at that position. It handles collisions using chaining or open addressing.

5. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `final` keyword in Java?
   - **Answer:** `final` is used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance. It can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.

6. **Question:** What is the difference between `throw` and `throws` in Java?
   - **Answer:** `throw` is used to throw an exception explicitly, while `throws` is used in method signature to declare exceptions that may be thrown by the method.

7. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `transient` keyword in Java?
   - **Answer:** The `transient` keyword is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized. When the object is serialized, transient variables are excluded from the serialization process.

8. **Question:** What is the difference between `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` in Java?
   - **Answer:** Both `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` are used for mutable strings, but `StringBuffer` is synchronized and thread-safe, whereas `StringBuilder` is not synchronized and faster in single-threaded scenarios.

9. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `super` keyword in Java?
   - **Answer:** `super` refers to the superclass of the current object and is used to access superclass methods, constructors, or variables.

10. **Question:** Explain the concept of Java's garbage collection.
    - **Answer:** Garbage collection in Java is the process of automatically reclaiming memory by removing objects that are no longer in use (i.e., objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program).
