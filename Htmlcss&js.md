## Adavantages of the Html file is
- Easy to use
- Loose syntax (although, being too flexible will not comply with standards).
- Supported on almost every browser, if not all browsers.
- Widely used; established on almost every website, if not all websites.
- Very similar to XML syntax, which is increasingly used for data storage.
- Free - You need not buy any software.
- Easy to learn & code even for novice programmers.

## Disadvantage of the Html file is
- It cannot produce dynamic output alone, since it is a static language
- Sometimes, the structuring of HTML documents is hard to grasp
- You have to keep up with deprecated tags, and make sure not to use them
- Deprecated tags appear because another language that works with HTML has replaced the original work of the tag; thus the other language needs to be learned (most of the time, it is CSS)
- Security features offered by HTML are limited.
